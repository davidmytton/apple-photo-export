# Apple Photo Export

A simple macOS app to export all photos from Apple Photos (and iCloud).

You can use the [Apple Privacy tool](https://privacy.apple.com) to export all photos from iCloud, however it takes several days to generate the export which you then have to download and copy to your final export destination. You can also export from Apple Photos itself (File > Export), but there is no easy to way to export all photos and keep the album organization.

This is a simple app for macOS which allows you to export all photos or pick specific albums. If you have all the photos already stored locally, it is very fast.
